# Changelog
- 4.10.0
  - Support Bootstrap (via `reactstrap`) (PR #604)
- 4.9.0
  - Added `is_null` and `is_not_null` operators (issue #494) (PR #522)
  - ! Breaking change for operators `is_empty` and `is_not_empty`. Left for text type only, for other types will be auto converted to `is_null`/`is_not_null`. Changed meaning of `is_empty` - now it's just strict comparing with empty string. Before change meaning was similar to `is_null` (and export to SQL was wrong because of non-existent operator `IS EMPTY`). (issue #494) (PR #573)
